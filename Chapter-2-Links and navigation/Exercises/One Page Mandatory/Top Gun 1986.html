      <p>Top Gun follows the journey of Pete "Maverick" Mitchell, a talented but reckless fighter pilot who is selected to train at the United States Navy's Fighter Weapons School, popularly known as "Top Gun."

As Maverick and his Radar Intercept Officer, Nick "Goose" Bradshaw, compete in aerial dogfights and face intense training exercises, Maverick also finds himself attracted to Charlie Blackwood, one of the school's civilian instructors. Maverick must confront his own insecurities and past traumas while striving to become the best fighter pilot in the Navy.</p>
