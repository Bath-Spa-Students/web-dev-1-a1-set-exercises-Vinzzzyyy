                The plot follows Pete "Maverick" Mitchell, a young naval aviator who aspires to be the top pilot in the Navy's elite fighter weapons school known as TOPGUN. Maverick's reckless flying and arrogant attitude put him at odds with the other pilots, particularly his rival, Iceman. Along the way, Maverick falls for Charlie, an astrophysics instructor, and must confront his own demons to become the best fighter pilot he can be.

            <ul>
                <li><em>Super Reviewer</em>:"Top Gun" has amazing acting from "Tom Cruise" and "Kelly McGillis". The plot to "Top Gun" is great and has great plot points. The special effects in this movie are incredible for a 1980's film. There are no action sequences that look like the back of a green screen."</li>
                <li><em>Common Sense Org</em>:"Made at the peak of Cruise's career in the 1980s, Top Gun is still exciting to watch. For all of the serious drama in the film, it's also heavy on action and charisma. Adults of a certain age will remember how it spawned a fashion movement of aviator glasses and bomber jackets and what a huge star Cruise was."</li>
                <li><em>Rotten Tomatoes</em>:"Top Gun is a star-studded and visually stimulating sensation that succeeds splendidly as a big-screen spectacle thanks to Tony Scott's distinguished direction and the charisma of its charming cast (most notably the transcendent Tom Cruise)."</li>
