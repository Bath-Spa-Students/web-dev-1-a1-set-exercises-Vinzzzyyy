      <p>Top Gun follows Lieutenant Pete "Maverick" Mitchell, a young naval aviator who gets accepted into the Navy's elite Fighter Weapons School, known as "Top Gun." While training at the school, Maverick competes against other top fighter pilots, including his rival, Lieutenant Tom "Iceman" Kazansky. Maverick's reckless flying style and his troubled past put him at odds with his instructors and fellow pilots. Along the way, he also forms a romantic relationship with his civilian instructor, Charlotte "Charlie" Blackwood.</p>
